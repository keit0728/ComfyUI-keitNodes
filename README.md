### üéØ Pixel Limit Resizer (16√ó)

An intelligent image resizing node that maintains aspect ratio while constraining pixel count and optimizing for 16-pixel multiple resolutions. Designed for 3D VAE spatiotemporal compression compatibility.

**Key Features:**
- **Pixel Count Limiting**: Calculates optimal resolution within specified pixel count constraints
- **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: Maintains original image aspect ratio as closely as possible
- **16-Pixel Multiple Constraint**: Adjusts width and height to be multiples of 16 (3D VAE compatible)
- **Multiple Upscale Methods**: Supports nearest-exact, bilinear, area, bicubic, lanczos interpolation methods
- **Detailed Output Information**: Provides resized image along with resolution metrics and aspect ratio data

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Default Max Pixels**: 728,320 (equivalent to 1138√ó640)
- **Minimum Resolution**: 16√ó16
- **Maximum Resolution**: 2048√ó2048
- **3D VAE Optimization**: Compatible with spatiotemporal compression (256√ó compression ready)
