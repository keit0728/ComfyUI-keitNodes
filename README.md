### 🎯 Pixel Limit Resizer (16×)

An intelligent image resizing node that maintains aspect ratio while constraining pixel count and optimizing for 16-pixel multiple resolutions. Designed for 3D VAE spatiotemporal compression compatibility.

**Key Features:**
- **Pixel Count Limiting**: Calculates optimal resolution within specified pixel count constraints
- **Aspect Ratio Preservation**: Maintains original image aspect ratio as closely as possible
- **16-Pixel Multiple Constraint**: Adjusts width and height to be multiples of 16 (3D VAE compatible)
- **Multiple Upscale Methods**: Supports nearest-exact, bilinear, area, bicubic, lanczos interpolation methods
- **Detailed Output Information**: Provides resized image along with resolution metrics and aspect ratio data

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Default Max Pixels**: 589,824 (equivalent to 1024×576)
- **Minimum Resolution**: 16×16
- **Maximum Resolution**: 2048×2048
- **3D VAE Optimization**: Compatible with spatiotemporal compression (256× compression ready)

### 📺 WanVideo Optimal Resizer

A preset resolution conversion node optimized for the WanVideo platform. Analyzes input image aspect ratios and automatically selects the most suitable resolution from predefined presets for resizing.

**Key Features:**
- **Preset Resolutions**: Supports two presets - 480p and 720p
- **Multiple Aspect Ratio Support**: Each preset supports 5 different aspect ratios:
  - 16:9 vertical & horizontal
  - 1:1 square
  - Landscape (1.29:1 / 1.31:1)
  - Portrait (1:1.29 / 1:1.31)
- **Intelligent Selection**: Two-stage selection algorithm considering aspect ratio similarity and pixel count difference
- **Detailed Analysis**: Outputs comprehensive statistics before and after resizing

**Preset Resolutions:**

**480p Preset:**
- 480×832 (16:9 vertical)
- 832×480 (16:9 horizontal)
- 624×624 (1:1 square)
- 704×544 (1.29:1 landscape)
- 544×704 (1:1.29 portrait)

**720p Preset:**
- 720×1280 (16:9 vertical)
- 1280×720 (16:9 horizontal)
- 960×960 (1:1 square)
- 1088×832 (1.31:1 landscape)
- 832×1088 (1:1.31 portrait)

**Selection Algorithm:**
1. **Aspect Ratio Priority**: Identifies candidates with aspect ratios closest to the original image
2. **Resolution Optimization**: Selects the candidate with pixel count closest to the original among optimal aspect ratio matches

### 🔍 WanVideo Resolution Finder

An optimal resolution calculation node for the WanVideo platform. Uses the same algorithm as WanVideo Optimal Resizer but only returns the optimal resolution values without performing the actual resize.

**Key Features:**
- **Resolution Calculation Only**: Outputs optimal width and height values without resizing the image
- **Identical Algorithm**: Uses the same selection logic as WanVideo Optimal Resizer
- **Preset Support**: Choose between 480p and 720p presets
- **Lightweight Processing**: Fast operation as no image processing is performed

**Use Cases:**
- When you need to check optimal resolution before resizing
- When you want to use resolution information in other nodes
- When determining unified resolution for batch processing

**Output:**
- width (INT): Optimal width in pixels
- height (INT): Optimal height in pixels
